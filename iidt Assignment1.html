        <h2>Krishna And his Friends</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time in the sacred land of Vrindavan, little Lord Krishna and his friends Balarama, Sudama, and Madhumangal were playing near the Yamuna river.</p>

    <p>They loved their carefree days, filled with laughter and joy.
             One sunny morning, Krishna suggested, "Let's go explore the forests 
             beyond the river. I've heard tales of mysterious creatures living
              there."</p>
            
            <p>Excited by the prospect of adventure, the boys eagerly crossed the 
            river and ventured into the dense woods. They encountered playful 
            monkeys, colorful birds, and exotic flowers along the way.</p>
            
        <p> As they delved deeper into the forest, Krishna's mischievous nature
             sparked an idea. He whispered to his friends, "Let's play a prank 
             on the village girls who come here to collect water. Hide behind the 
             trees and mimic the sound of the flute."</p>
            
            <p>With mischievous grins, the boys followed Krishna's lead. When the 
            village girls arrived at the riverbank, they heard enchanting flute 
            melodies echoing through the trees. Thinking it was Krishna, they
             giggled and called out his name.</p>
            
            <p>But to their surprise, they found no one there. Confused, they 
            searched high and low, but Krishna and his friends remained hidden, 
            giggling with delight.</p>
            
            <p>After a while, Krishna emerged from his hiding spot, his laughter 
            contagious. The girls, initially annoyed, couldn't help but join in
             the merriment.</p>
            
            <p>From that day on, Krishna and his friends continued their mischievous
             adventures, spreading joy and laughter wherever they went.
